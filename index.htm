<p>Valorant is a free-to-play first-person hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games, for Microsoft Windows. First teased under the codename Project A in October 2019, the game began a closed beta period with limited access on April 7, 2020, followed by an official release on June 2, 2020 </p>

<p> In comparison to other popular online multiplayer games, Valorant has a lot more in common with the likes of CS:GO, rather than PUBG and Fortnite. Similar to CS: GO, here one team attacks while the other defends. The defensive team plants a bomb and then tries to stop the offensive team from defusing it. Teams can swap between attacks and defence after 3 rounds</p>
